How to add RedBeanPHP to Composer
=======

Just a small composer.json file that manually adds RedBeanPHP.php to any composer.json project.

#### Problem:

RedBeanPHP is awesome but does not support Composer ([see here](http://redbeanphp.com/manual3_0/installing)).

It's a workaround, that i use, so be carefull
